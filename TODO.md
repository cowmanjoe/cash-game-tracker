# TODO

- Add UI for cash out, how do we do this part?
  - Could have it on the same UI for buy in with a drop down?
  - Is it confusing UX if the add button overwrites the original cash out?
- Fix precision for cash outs.
- Show an error message on invalid form submit for edit buy in
- Add button for delete buy in with confirmation.
- Change view to be a feed of all buy ins, cash outs and payments.
- Create ledger page that shows all players' current balances.
- Make a sticky button for adding a buy in.
- Clean up UI in join game page.
- Edit payment page should allow editing the payment side
- Make the transfer viewing pages consistent, modeled after the payment page
- Allow filtering transfers by player in the transfer table
- UI on balances page to show the payments. Maybe some kind of visual to indicate the amounts in chips (buy ins and cash outs) vs the amounts in dollars (payments)
