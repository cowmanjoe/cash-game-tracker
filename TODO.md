# TODO

- Edit payment page should allow editing the payment side
- Make the transfer viewing pages consistent, modeled after the payment page
- Allow filtering transfers by player in the transfer table
- UI on balances page to show the payments. Maybe some kind of visual to indicate the amounts in chips (buy ins and cash outs) vs the amounts in dollars (payments)
- Make a sticky button for adding a buy in.
- Clean up UI in join game page.
